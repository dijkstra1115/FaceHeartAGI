	"condition": "Hypertension",
	"description": "Blood pressure refers to the pressure exerted by blood against the walls of blood vessels as it flows from the heart. Systolic pressure is the pressure generated when the heart contracts and pumps blood into the arteries, while diastolic pressure is the pressure maintained by arterial elasticity during heart relaxation.",
	"symptoms": [
		"Headache: occipital headache, neck stiffness, most common in the early morning, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness",
		"Dizziness, facial flushing, fatigue, blurred vision",
		"Nocturia",
		"Angina",
		"Lower limb edema, shortness of breath during exercise",
		"Retinal hemorrhage and exudates"
	],
	"diagnosis": [
		"Blood pressure above 130/80 mmHg is considered hypertension",
		"Blood pressure above 135/85 mmHg is considered hypertension"
	],
	"recommendations": {
	  	"general": [
			"Maintain a regular routine and avoid overexertion to help control blood pressure"
	  	],
		"diet": [
			"Reducing salt intake is a key measure in preventing hypertension",
			"Increase intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, and reduce consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol",
			"Reduce saturated and trans fat",
			"Stimulant beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola may raise blood pressure and should be avoided",
			"Control total caloric intake to maintain a healthy weight"
		],
		"exercise": [
			"Engage in aerobic exercise at least 3-5 times a week, for more than 30 minutes each time"
		],
		"monitoring": [
			"Have regular health check-ups to monitor blood pressure",
			"Follow medical instructions and take antihypertensive medications as prescribed; do not adjust dosage or stop medication on your own",
			"Follow the '722' rule for blood pressure monitoring: measure for 7 consecutive days, at 2 times each day (morning and before bed), and take 2 readings each time (1 minute apart)"
		],
		"lifestyle": [
			"Smoking and alcohol increase cardiovascular burden, promote atherosclerosis, and raise the risk of hypertension, so they should be avoided",
			"Lack of sleep can elevate blood pressure; maintain regular sleep habits and ensure adequate rest",
			"Avoid excessive stress and excitement; learning to relax can help stabilize blood pressure",
			"Avoid sudden temperature changes; keep warm especially when going out in cold seasons",
			"Straining during constipation can raise blood pressure; increase intake of high-fiber foods to maintain smooth bowel movements"

	"ethnic": [
		"In the U.S., between 2017 and 2018, the prevalence of hypertension among Black adults was 57%, compared to 44% among White adults",
		"Blacks tend to develop hypertension earlier than Whites",
		"Among younger populations, hypertension is especially serious among Blacks",
		"Hypertension tends to be more severe in Blacks than in Whites, and complications are more common",
		"Blacks have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases caused by hypertension, such as stroke and heart failure, compared to other ethnic groups"
