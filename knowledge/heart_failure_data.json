    "condition": "Heart Failure",
    "description": "Heart failure refers to the heart's inability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It may result from the heart not filling with enough blood, or the heart not pumping with enough force—sometimes both conditions occur simultaneously. Heart failure does not mean the heart has stopped working, but that it requires medical attention due to its serious dysfunction.",
    "symptoms": [
        "Fatigue: slow reactions, poor concentration, reduced physical performance, loss of appetite or nausea",
        "Edema: swelling in the legs and abdomen, weight gain, decreased urine output",
        "Shortness of breath: difficulty breathing when lying flat, relieved by sitting up",
        "Cough and sputum: sputum may be blood-tinged",
        "Irregular heartbeat: rapid or irregular heartbeat"
    ],
    "diagnosis": [
        "Echocardiogram: checks structure, function, and valve issues",
        "Chest X-ray: assesses heart size, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion",
        "Electrocardiogram (ECG): detects arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia",
        "NT-proBNP: heart failure marker, higher levels indicate more severe condition",
        "Blood tests: liver and kidney function, electrolytes, thyroid function, blood sugar, cholesterol",
        "Coronary angiography, exercise ECG, cardiac catheterization"

            "Pay attention to symptoms like shortness of breath, abnormal sputum, irregular heartbeat, and chest pain—seek medical attention early",

        "monitoring": [
            "Regularly record weight and symptom changes",
